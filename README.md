This is a frontend application created using ```ReactJS``` and ```tailwindCSS``` for styling.

## Misc

Following are the packages used and their used to implement the corresponding features
1. ```react-awesome-reveal```: to implement the animations when user scrolls to each section on the page
2. ```react-scroll```: to implement the smooth scrolling on the page to visit to the required sections
3. ```react-icons```: to make use of the icons
4. ```react-vertical-timeline-component```: to implement the Education section on the page
5. ```typewriter-effect```: to display data in the typewrite effect
6. To implement the contact form submit, I have made use of the [GetForm](https://getform.io/) tool.
